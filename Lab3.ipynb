    "### Task Explanation and Business Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the dataset was to predict customer satisfaction,  however to fullfil the requires that dataset must contain three or more classes to predict.  We are explring an alternative classification problem within the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset which is to predict the travel class of passengers (i.e., Business, Economy, and Economy Plus). Here’s is how we are framing this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Task: Predict Passenger Travel Class\n",
    "This task involves predicting whether a passenger is flying in Business Class, Economy Class, or Economy Plus based on various features available in the dataset. To predict travel class effectively, several features from the dataset are likely to be important. Here are some key features that can significantly influence the prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flight Distance:** Longer flights might have a higher proportion of Business and Economy Plus passengers.\n",
    "2. **In-flight Services:** Ratings for Wi-Fi, entertainment, and seat comfort can indicate the class, as Business class typically offers superior services.\n",
    "3. **Baggage Handling:** Satisfaction with baggage handling might correlate with higher travel classes.\n",
    "4. **Customer Satisfaction:** Overall satisfaction scores can be higher for Business and Economy Plus passengers.\n",
    "5. **Flight Delays:** Passengers in higher classes might experience fewer delays or have different perceptions of delays.\n",
    "6. **Age:** Different age groups might prefer different travel classes.\n",
    "7. **Gender:** There might be trends in travel class preferences based on gender.\n",
    "8. **Type of Traveler:** Business travelers are more likely to be in Business class, while leisure travelers might prefer Economy or Economy Plus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Use-Case:\n",
    "The goal of predicting travel class can provide insights into passenger behavior and help airlines such as American Airlines (AA) to optimize their service offerings and revenue management strategies. Airlines could use this information for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue Optimization:** Understanding the factors that influence travel class choices allows airlines to adjust pricing, promotions, and services to encourage passengers to upgrade to higher classes (e.g., from Economy to Economy Plus or Business).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Passenger Segmentation:** Airlines can use this model to tailor services to specific passenger segments, such as offering personalized upgrades or add-on services to Economy Plus passengers likely to switch to Business class. Currently, American Airlines does not offer upgrades to their lowest tier(Economy) customers to switch to top tier(Buisness class).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operational Efficiency:** The model can help forecast the demand for each travel class on specific routes, allowing airlines to adjust flight capacity (e.g., increasing Business class seats on popular routes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interested Parties:\n",
    "The parties at American Airlines that would be interested in the results are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revenue Management Teams:** They can use the model to identify passengers more likely to purchase upgrades or additional services, optimizing pricing strategies for different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Experience Teams:** Understanding class preferences allows these teams to tailor in-flight experiences, loyalty rewards, and offers based on predicted class choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Airline Executives:** Senior leadership can make data-driven decisions regarding fleet configuration (e.g., more Business class seats on high-demand routes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Marketing Teams:** These teams can leverage insights to create targeted promotions and campaigns for each class of traveler, improving customer acquisition and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Offline Analysis vs. Deployed Model:\n",
    "- **Offline Analysis:** This model can be used to identify travel class trends for various passenger demographics, seasonality, or routes. This helps in revenue forecasting, adjusting pricing strategies, and configuring flight classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployed Model:** It can also be deployed in the booking system to predict and offer real-time travel class upgrades or special offers for passengers who are likely to switch from Economy to Economy Plus or Business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Requirements:\n",
    "To be valuable for real-time deployment or offline analysis, the model should ideally achieve at least 80% accuracy or higher. However, since American Airlines make significant revenue from upgrades, improving the precision and recall for Business class predictions may be crucial. Airlines would aim for high recall (e.g., >90%) in identifying potential Business class passengers, as a missed opportunity here could directly impact revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier's performance could also be evaluated using F1-score, particularly for underrepresented classes (e.g., Economy Plus, which might have fewer passengers than Economy)."
